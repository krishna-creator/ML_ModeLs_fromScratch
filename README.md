# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of five machine learning models from scratch using only NumPy. The models are applied to two datasets: the MNIST Fashion dataset (multiclass classification) and the Rice dataset (binary classification).

## Implemented Models
1. **Perceptron**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Softmax Regression**
4. **Logistic Regression**
5. **Linear Regression**

## Datasets
### MNIST Fashion Dataset
- **Type:** Multiclass classification
- **Description:** The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, each associated with a label from 10 classes (e.g., T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, etc.).

### Rice Dataset
- **Type:** Binary classification
- **Description:** The dataset consists of measurements of rice grains, used to classify them into two varieties.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
